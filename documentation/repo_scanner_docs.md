## Repository Documentation Generator

This repository documentation generator uses Google's Gemini AI to analyze Python files and generate detailed markdown documentation. It can be used to automatically create documentation for your Python projects.

### Features

- Analyzes Python files using Gemini AI
- Generates markdown documentation summarizing the code
- Creates a documentation directory within the repository
- Optionally creates a pull request with the documentation changes
- Includes a simple documentation web server for easy viewing

### Usage

To use this generator, clone this repository and install the required dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/repo-documentation-generator
cd repo-documentation-generator
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Set your GitHub token in the `.env` file:

```
GITHUB_TOKEN=<your-github-token>
```

Configure your Gemini API key in the `.env` file (optional):

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=<your-gemini-api-key>
```

Then, you can use the following command to scan a repository and generate documentation:

```
python main.py <repo-url> <target-dir>
```

Replace `<repo-url>` with the URL of the repository you want to scan, and `<target-dir>` with the directory where you want to clone the repository.

### Options

The following options are available:

- `--create-pr`: Create a pull request with the documentation changes.
- `--serve`: Start a documentation web server after generation.
- `--port`: Port for the documentation server (default: 5000).

### Example

To scan the `my-project` repository on GitHub and generate documentation, you would run:

```
python main.py https://github.com/my-username/my-project my-project-docs
```

This will clone the repository into the `my-project-docs` directory, scan it for Python files, and generate documentation for each file. The documentation will be stored in the `documentation` directory within the cloned repository.

## Documentation Analysis

The documentation generated by this tool uses Google's Gemini AI to analyze the code and provide insights. The analysis includes:

### Overview of Functionality

A brief description of what the code does and how it works.

### Key Components and Their Purpose

A list of the main components in the code and what each one does.

### Usage Examples

If applicable, examples of how to use the code.

### Dependencies and Requirements

A list of the dependencies required to run the code.

### Notable Design Decisions

A discussion of any significant design decisions made in the code.

## Web Server

The documentation web server allows you to easily view the generated documentation. To start the server, run the following command:

```
python doc_server.py
```

The server will be accessible at `http://localhost:5000` (or the port specified by the `--port` option).
