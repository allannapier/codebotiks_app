# Documentation for `test_repo_scanner.py`

---

## Overview

`repo_scanner` is a command-line tool that helps you scan Python code in repositories and generate documentation based on the code. The tool clones the repository and runs static analysis on each Python file in the cloned repository. It generates markdown documentation for each Python file and places it in a `documentation` directory within the cloned repository. The tool can also create a pull request to merge the documentation changes back into the repository.

## Key Components and Purpose

The key components of `repo_scanner` are:

- `extract_repo_info`: Extracts the repository name and owner from a URL.
- `create_pull_request`: Creates a pull request on GitHub with generated documentation.
- `remove_directory`: Removes a directory.
- `analyze_python_file`: Analyzes a Python file using the Gemini API and generates markdown documentation.
- `create_documentation_file`: Creates a markdown documentation file based on the analysis result.
- `clone_repository`: Clones a repository to a local directory.
- `scan_repository`: Scans a repository for Python files and generates documentation files.
- `main`: The entry point of the tool, which parses command-line arguments and calls other functions to perform the required actions.

## Usage Examples

To use `repo_scanner`, pass the following arguments to the command line:

1. The URL of the repository to scan
2. The local directory where the repository should be cloned
3. Optional flags:
   - `--create-pr`: Creates a pull request with the generated documentation.
   - `--serve`: Starts a local development server for the generated documentation.
   - `--port`: Specifies the port number for the development server.

Example:

```bash
python repo_scanner.py https://github.com/user/repo /tmp/repo
```

This command will clone the `user/repo` repository to the `/tmp/repo` directory, perform static analysis on the Python files, create markdown documentation files, and save them in a `documentation` directory within the cloned repository.

To create a pull request with the generated documentation, add the `--create-pr` flag:

```bash
python repo_scanner.py https://github.com/user/repo /tmp/repo --create-pr
```

To start a local development server for the generated documentation, add the `--serve` and `--port` flags:

```bash
python repo_scanner.py https://github.com/user/repo /tmp/repo --serve --port 8000
```

## Dependencies and Requirements

`repo_scanner` requires the following dependencies:

- Python 3.6 or later
- gitpython
- shutil
- subprocess
- pathlib
- doc_server (for serving documentation locally)
- Gemini API key (for generating documentation)

## Notable Design Decisions

- The tool uses the Gemini API for static analysis of Python code.
- The documentation files are placed in a `documentation` directory within the cloned repository to keep them organized and separate from the source code.
- The tool provides various command-line flags to customize its behavior and enable easy integration with different workflows.
