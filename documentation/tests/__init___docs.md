## Code Analysis - Python

### Overview of Functionality

This code performs a series of operations on a list of numbers:

1. Calculates the sum of all numbers in the list.
2. Finds the maximum number in the list.
3. Finds the minimum number in the list.
4. Calculates the average of all numbers in the list.

### Key Components and their Purpose

- `numbers`: A list of numbers.
- `sum()`: A built-in Python function that calculates the sum of a list of numbers.
- `max()`: A built-in Python function that finds the maximum value in a list.
- `min()`: A built-in Python function that finds the minimum value in a list.

### Usage Examples

```python
# Example 1: Calculate the sum, maximum, minimum, and average of a list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = calculate_sum_max_min_avg(numbers)
print(result)  # Output: (15, 5, 1, 3.0)

# Example 2: Use the result to perform further calculations or display the results
total_sum = result[0]
max_value = result[1]
min_value = result[2]
avg_value = result[3]
```

### Dependencies and Requirements

- Python 3 or higher

### Notable Design Decisions

- The function `calculate_sum_max_min_avg` is designed to be general-purpose and can be used to calculate these values for any list of numbers.
- The function returns a tuple containing the sum, maximum, minimum, and average values, allowing multiple results to be obtained with a single function call.
- The function uses the built-in Python functions `sum()`, `max()`, and `min()` to ensure efficient and reliable calculations.
