# Documentation for `test_doc_server.py`

---

## Overview

This Python code provides a set of utilities for working with documentation within a Python application. It includes functions for listing and reading markdown files, as well as a Flask application for serving documentation.

## Key Components

### Functions

- `get_documentation_files`: Lists markdown documentation files in a directory and returns them as a list of dictionaries with `name` and `directory` keys.
- `read_markdown_file`: Reads a markdown file and converts it to HTML.
- `app`: A Flask application that serves the documentation.

### Routes

- `/`: Index route for the documentation viewer.
- `/api/docs`: API that returns a list of documentation files.
- `/api/doc/<filename>`: API that returns the content of a documentation file.
- Static file serving for CSS and other static assets.

## Usage

### Listing Documentation Files

```python
import doc_server

# Get a list of documentation files in a directory
files = doc_server.get_documentation_files("documentation_directory")
```

### Reading Markdown Files

```python
import doc_server

# Read a markdown file and convert it to HTML
content = doc_server.read_markdown_file("documentation_directory", "filename.md")
```

### Serving Documentation with Flask

```python
import doc_server

# Instantiate the Flask application
app = doc_server.app

# Run the Flask application
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
```

## Dependencies and Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Flask
- Jinja2
- Markdown
- Pathlib

## Notable Design Decisions

- The Flask application uses Jinja2 templating for rendering HTML.
- The API uses JSON responses.
- Static files are served from a static directory within the application.
